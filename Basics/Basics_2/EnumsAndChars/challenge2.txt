. In this challenge, you are to create a program that displays the perimeter and area of a rectangle.

. The program should create 4 variables of type double
    . one variable to store the width of the rectangle
    . one variable to store the height of the rectangle
    . one variable to store the perimeter of the rectangle
    . one variable to store the area of the rectangle

. The program should perform the calculation for the perimeter of a rectangle
    . Use the + operator addition and the * operator multiplication 
    . Perimeter is calculated by adding the height and width of the rectangle and then multiplying by two
    . Area is calculated by multiplying the width * height of the variables


. The program should display the height, width, and perimeter variables in the correct format in one print statement.

. The program should display the height, width, and area variables in the correct format in one print statement.
